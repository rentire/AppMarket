    "Description": "Best Circle Fit is the best &quot;must have&quot; casual game for tablets &amp; phones. Easy to play, hard to quit, but well...it&#39;s a bit annoying and being smart and fast is your way out.Best Circle Fit is a cute, minimalist game of reflexes that has simplicity and addictive gameplay. The mechanics are actually really simple: tap the screen to release the ball and make sure they never touch. The balls will follow a circle pattern and your task will be to release all of them strategically, keeping them all separated.The trick? A ball&#39;s direction might be right or left and you never really know the exact path it will follow. So cross your fingers and pray you&#39;ve tapped at the right moment. You might&#39;ve gotten it right (or not!)Whoever tried this game first said:&quot;This game is easy, dude&quot; but then they tore their hair out.Just download and enjoy 559 different levels.Try not to hesitate to contact with us:info@rentiregames.comRentire Games",
